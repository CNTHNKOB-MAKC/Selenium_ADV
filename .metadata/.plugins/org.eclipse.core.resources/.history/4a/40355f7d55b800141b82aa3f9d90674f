package core.Selenium_ADV_Day_01;
/*Part A:
Install and configure Eclipse IDE.
Create a simple WebDriver test.
Debug, and ensure you can execute it from Eclipse IDE.

Test:
1. Login (admin/Password)
2. On the Dashboard locate the quickLaungeContainer and ensure that the footer text is displayed correctly under each image.
3. Start by checking the first image footer, and after everything passes, try to also check the other 2 image footers.

Part B: Optional
Please note: you need to be already familiar with Actions (action chains) to do this. We will be covering Actions in class next week, so this part is bonus.

Test:
1. Login (admin/Password)
2. Go to PIM > Employee List
3. Ensure that all even rows have ‘even’ class, and all odd rows have ‘odd’ class. 

HINT: Locators for Part A and B were discussed in class, and can be found here:
